# Phase-2

In Phase-2 of training we will be focusing on the following

- Ansible Basics
  - Inventory
  - Variables
  - Ad hoc commands
  - Tasks
  - Playbooks
  - Roles
  - Conditionals
  - Loops
  - Ansible Modules
  - Collections
    - Arista EOS Collection

You will find a folder has been created for each of the above topics.

Each folder contains a `Demo` sub-folder.

The `Demo` sub-folder will contain scripts/commands being used in the training which you can copy and work along with the trainer during the training.

Under each folder you will find details and instructions about the topic in the README.md file.

For any queries or issues please reach out to the maintainer.

**We highly recommend going through Phase-1 Labs and exercises prior to starting with Phase-2.**
