# Phase-2

In Phase-2 of training we will be focusing on the following

- Ansible Basics
  - Inventory
  - Variables
  - Tasks
  - Playbooks
  - Roles
  - Conditionals
  - Loops
  - Ansible Modules
  - Collections
    - Arista EOS Collection
    - Arista CVP Collection

You will find a folder has been created for each of the above topics.

Each folder contains a `Demo` and `Lab` sub-folder.

The `Demo` sub-folder will contain scripts/commands being used in the training which you can copy and work along with the trainer during the training.

The `Lab` sub-folder contains challenge labs for practise as per trainers instructions. The folder also contains solution file, but we would recommend to not take a peek at those first :)

Under each folder you will find details and instructions about the topic in the README.md file.

For any queries or issues please reach out to the maintainer.

**We highly recommend going through Phase-1 Labs and exercises prior to starting with Phase-2.**
