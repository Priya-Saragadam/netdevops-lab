# YAML module Lab

In this module your skills will be tested on what you have learned about YAML.

From the `Programmability IDE` perform the following operations.

## Challenge-1

- In the `food.yaml` file we have updated information about `apple`, similarly update the remaining information (HINT: Use list of dictionaries):

| fruits | calories | fat | carbs |
| ------ | -------- | --- | ----- |
| apple | 95 | 0.3 | 25 |
| banana | 105 | 0.4 | 27 |
| orange | 45 | 0.1 | 11

## Challenge-2

- In the `food.yaml` file update information about `vegetables`, similar to how we have done for `fruits`

| vegetables | calories | fat | carbs |
| ---------- | -------- | --- | ----- |
| carrot | 25 | 0.1 | 6 |
| tomato | 22 | 0.2 | 4.8 |
| cucumber | 8 | 0.1 | 1.9 |

## Challenge-3

- Create a new file `employee-directory.yaml` and configure it as below.

- Tom is `30` year old Male working as a `Technical Solutions Engineer` at a firm. Represent Tom's information (`Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `Title`) in yaml format. Create a dictionary named `Employee` and define properties under it.

## Challenge-4

- Update the yaml file to represent the `Projects` assigned to Tom. Remember Tom works on Multiple projects - `Automation` and `Support`. So remember to use a list.

## Challenge-5

- Update the yaml file to include Tom's pay slips. Add a new property `Payslips` and create a list of pay slip details (Use list of dictionaries). Each payslip detail contains `Month` and `Wage`.

| Month | Wage |
| ----- | ---- |
| October | 4000 |
| November | 4500 |
| December | 4000 |

The solutions for these challenges are present under `Solutions` folder, however we would encourage to try to figure our the solution yourself before looking at the solutions.

## Challenge-6

- Using EAPI & python script get the output of `show version` from all switches except `cvx01` and print it in YAML format.
