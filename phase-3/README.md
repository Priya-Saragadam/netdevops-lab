# Phase 3 - Advanced Topics

In this section we will be focusing on demo and labs around the `Arista Validated Designs` (AVD).

You will find there are 2 demo labs created:

- Demo-1 ( Single DC L3LS deployment using eAPI )
- Demo-2 ( Single DC L3LS deployment using CVP )

2 practice labs have been created with for self study, based on the Demo labs.

For any queries or issues please reach out to the maintainer.

**We highly recommend going through Phase-1 & Phase-2 Labs and exercises prior to starting with Phase-3.**
